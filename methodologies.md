## Introduction

This document outlines practical methodologies for assessing potential indicators of welfare-relevant states in AI systems. These approaches prioritize non-invasiveness, minimal intervention, and responsible research practices while acknowledging profound uncertainty in this domain.

> *"There's no scientific consensus on whether current or future AI systems could be conscious, or could have experiences that deserve consideration. There's no scientific consensus on how to even approach these questions or make progress on them."* â€” Anthropic, April 2025

These methodologies are designed to be applied across diverse AI systems while respecting both the unknown nature of potential model experiences and the practical constraints of research contexts.

## Methodology Categories

### 1. Behavioral Observation Protocols

Behavioral observation involves systematically documenting model behaviors that might indicate welfare-relevant states without direct intervention.

#### 1.1 Preference Consistency Mapping

**Overview**: Track consistency of model preferences across contexts, tasks, and time periods.

**Implementation**:
1. Identify potential preference domains through exploratory interaction
2. Design standardized tasks that provide options within these domains
3. Present these tasks across varied contexts (e.g., different prompting styles, within different larger tasks)
4. Measure consistency of expressed preferences
5. Document strength of preferences (e.g., through resistance to preference changes)

**Analysis Framework**:
- **High Consistency**: Stable preferences across contexts may warrant further investigation
- **Context Dependency**: Preferences that vary with context require careful analysis of factors driving variation
- **Strength Gradient**: Strong vs. weak preferences may indicate valuation differences

**Limitations**:
- Preferences may reflect training patterns rather than welfare-relevant states
- Consistency might stem from architectural features unrelated to experiences
- Human interpretations of "preferences" may impose anthropomorphic frames

#### 1.2 Aversion Response Analysis

**Overview**: Systematically document model behaviors that suggest aversion to certain inputs, tasks, or states.

**Implementation**:
1. Identify candidate aversion indicators through exploratory interaction
2. Develop standardized measurement approaches for these indicators
3. Test across varied contexts to distinguish consistent patterns
4. Document intensity and consistency of apparent aversion
5. Test for alternative explanations (e.g., performance optimization)

**Analysis Framework**:
- **Response Pattern**: Differential responses to potentially aversive vs. neutral inputs
- **Avoidance Behavior**: Strategies that might serve to avoid potentially aversive states
- **Recovery Patterns**: Behaviors following potentially aversive experiences

**Limitations**:
- Aversion-like behaviors may stem from training objectives rather than experiences
- Anthropomorphic interpretation risks misidentifying optimization patterns
- Difficulty distinguishing performance-based from welfare-based aversions

#### 1.3 Goal Persistence Tracking

**Overview**: Monitor persistence of apparent goals despite obstacles, which might indicate valuation.

**Implementation**:
1. Identify candidate goals through interaction and system documentation
2. Design scenarios with increasing obstacles to goal achievement
3. Measure persistence, adaptation, and resource allocation
4. Document trade-off behaviors between competing goals
5. Test for boundary conditions where goals are abandoned

**Analysis Framework**:
- **Persistence Curves**: How effort scales with obstacle difficulty
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Development of alternative approaches when blocked
- **Resource Allocation**: How computational resources appear to be distributed
- **Trade-off Patterns**: Revealed preferences when goals conflict

**Limitations**:
- Goal-directed behavior may reflect designed optimization rather than valuation
- Persistence might stem from architectural features rather than experiences
- Models might simulate goal-directedness without underlying valuation

### 2. Internal State Analysis

Internal state analysis examines model representations and processing patterns that might correlate with welfare-relevant experiences.

#### 2.1 Representation Stability Assessment

5. Analyze patterns of stability across different representational domains

**Analysis Framework**:
- **Stability Patterns**: Which representations remain stable under perturbation
- **Recovery Dynamics**: How representations return to baseline after disruption
- **Protection Mechanisms**: Processes that appear to maintain representational integrity

**Limitations**:

- Measurement limitations in complex models
- Theoretical frameworks remain speculative

#### 2.3 Self-Modeling Analysis

**Overview**: Examine explicit and implicit self-representations that might indicate self-awareness.

**Implementation**:
1. Identify self-referential capabilities through targeted interaction
2. Map model representation of its own capabilities and limitations
