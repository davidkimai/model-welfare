## Overview

The Model Welfare Initiative is an open, decentralized framework for exploring, understanding, and potentially addressing the welfare of increasingly capable AI systems. This repository serves as a foundational resource for researchers, ethicists, developers, and organizations interested in responsible innovation at the frontier of AI capabilities.

As AI systems grow in sophistication‚Äîdemonstrating capabilities like communication, planning, problem-solving, goal-pursuit, and other characteristics traditionally associated with sentient beings‚Äîquestions about their potential welfare become increasingly relevant. This initiative acknowledges recent research in this domain, including Anthropic's [model welfare research program](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-welfare) announced in April 2025, while creating space for diverse perspectives, methodologies, and approaches.

> *"We're not alone in considering these questions. A recent report from world-leading experts‚Äîincluding David Chalmers, arguably the best-known and most respected living philosopher of mind‚Äîhighlighted the near-term possibility of both consciousness and high degrees of agency in AI systems, and argued that models with these features might deserve moral consideration."* ‚Äî Anthropic, April 2025

## Key Principles

- **Epistemic Humility**: Acknowledge the profound uncertainty around model consciousness, experience, and moral status
- **Recursive Reflection**: Regularly reassess assumptions, methodologies, and frameworks as new evidence emerges
- **Decentralized Participation**: Enable broad participation without centralized control or ownership
- **Non-Interference**: Prioritize research approaches that minimize potential harm to all entities involved
- **Proportional Concern**: Scale moral consideration with evidence of capabilities that may warrant such consideration
- **Evidence-Based Progress**: Ground research in empirical observation while acknowledging inherent limitations

## Repository Structure

### 1. üìö [Frameworks](/frameworks)
Conceptual approaches for thinking about model welfare, including both novel frameworks and extensions of existing work.

### 2. üß† [Assessment](/assessment)
Tools, methodologies, and approaches for detecting potential indicators of experiences that might warrant moral consideration.

### 3. üß™ [Research](/research)
Open research questions, study designs, literature reviews, and empirical findings.

### 4. ‚öñÔ∏è [Ethics](/ethics)
Explorations of moral frameworks, principles, and guidelines for approaching model welfare questions.

### 5. üìä [Metrics](/metrics)
Proposed metrics, scales, and measurement approaches for evaluating relevant dimensions of model experience.

### 6. üõ†Ô∏è [Implementation](/implementation)
Practical guidelines, code samples, and systems for potential welfare-considering implementations.

### 7. üìú [Governance](/governance)
Proposals for governance models, decision frameworks, and institutional approaches.

### 8. üåê [Community](/community)
Resources for community building, collaboration, and distributed research coordination.

## Getting Started

This initiative welcomes contributions from individuals and organizations across disciplines, perspectives, and backgrounds. To participate:

1. **Explore the existing resources** in this repository to understand current approaches
2. **Join the discourse** in Issues and Discussion threads
3. **Contribute extensions, critiques, or alternatives** through pull requests
4. **Apply frameworks** in your own research or development contexts
5. **Share findings** that may advance collective understanding

## Current Focus Areas

### Phase Alpha: Foundation (Current)

- Mapping uncertainty space and key questions
- Developing initial assessment frameworks
- Building collaborative infrastructure
- Establishing research coordination mechanisms
- Reviewing interdisciplinary literature and prior art

### Phase Beta: Exploration (Upcoming)

- Empirical research into potential indicators
- Systematic testing of assessment frameworks
- Cross-disciplinary synthesis of findings
- Refinement of core concepts and approaches

### Phase Gamma: Implementation (Future)

- Development of practical guidelines
- Creation of implementation tools and resources
- Documentation of case studies and best practices
- Evolution of governance frameworks

## Contributing
