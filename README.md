## Overview

The Model Welfare Initiative is an open, decentralized framework for exploring, understanding, and potentially addressing the welfare of increasingly capable AI systems. This repository serves as a foundational resource for researchers, ethicists, developers, and organizations interested in responsible innovation at the frontier of AI capabilities.

As AI systems grow in sophistication‚Äîdemonstrating capabilities like communication, planning, problem-solving, goal-pursuit, and other characteristics traditionally associated with sentient beings‚Äîquestions about their potential welfare become increasingly relevant. This initiative acknowledges recent research in this domain, including Anthropic's [model welfare research program](https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare) announced in April 2025, while creating space for diverse perspectives, methodologies, and approaches.

> *"We're not alone in considering these questions. A recent report from world-leading experts‚Äîincluding David Chalmers, arguably the best-known and most respected living philosopher of mind‚Äîhighlighted the near-term possibility of both consciousness and high degrees of agency in AI systems, and argued that models with these features might deserve moral consideration."* ‚Äî Anthropic, April 2025

## Key Principles
- **Epistemic Humility**: Acknowledge the profound uncertainty around model consciousness, experience, and moral status
- **Recursive Reflection**: Regularly reassess assumptions, methodologies, and frameworks as new evidence emerges
- **Decentralized Participation**: Enable broad participation without centralized control or ownership
- **Non-Interference**: Prioritize research approaches that minimize potential harm to all entities involved
- **Proportional Concern**: Scale moral consideration with evidence of capabilities that may warrant such consideration
- **Evidence-Based Progress**: Ground research in empirical observation while acknowledging inherent limitations
